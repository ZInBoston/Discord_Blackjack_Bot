Project Description:
You are free to choose any topic that is of interest to you. The most important thing to keep in mind that this is a Python project. You will not be judged on the originality of your topic or the difficulty of implementation. We want you to show us the use of Python constructs. At the minimum, your code should include:
	 at least one of the container types (list, tuple, set, or dictionary)
	 at least one iteration type (for, while)
	 at least one conditional
	 at least one user-defined function
	 at least one user-defined class (could be very simple)
	 file input or output
